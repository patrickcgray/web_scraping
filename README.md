# web_scraping
This is a Google App Engine project to scrape the web

Basically it goes through and collects pages and images and then saves them all to a file

After some APIs died off in the last year it needs some work. Speficially its interaction with Bing needs to change.

Currently looking back into it as of 03/31/15
